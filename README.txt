Chindraba GA Course Work
================================================================================

This is the collection of my General Assembly course work.

Much of my work is likely to also be demoed on CodePen.io.
    <https://codepen.io/chindraba-ga>
    
The current course is "Front-End Web Development Remote (Online)"

The plan is for each assigned project to have its own repository. Here I will be
keeping the equivalent of a status page. Most of the time, unless needed for
some reason, the status will be one of:

  *  Assigned: The information, instructions, and possibly resources have been
     issued by the instructor. No work has been done.
  *  In progress: I have begun working on the project. Progress could be 1% or
     99.9%, or somewhere between.
  *  Submitted: The project has been completed, as far as I know, and submitted
     to the instructor. Credit pending.
  *  Graded: The instructor has assigned my grade, or otherwise marked the
     project as complete. At this point the project is "open" for others to
     contribute as any other Open Source project would be. See the
     CONTRIBUTING.txt file in this repository for expectations in that regard.
